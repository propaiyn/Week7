/* When you use the final keyword, that variable/method/class's value/method override/extension (RESPECTIVELY) can no longer be done
 * The VARIABLE would typically be STATIC; 1 refrence across all instances = SAME VALUE
 * FINAL METHODS are set when we are sure that the method will not need to be altered
 * Declared like this;
 *                   public final void method(){
 *                   }
 * CLASS - Use case is when the class will be the last child; NO INHERITANCE FROM THIS CLASS
